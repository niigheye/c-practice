 where 0≤ x ≤1, with a step h=0.2 Calculate the sum of the Taylor series with an error not exceeding 0.000001.
Present the result in the form of a table (without frames), which contains four rows with the values x, Y(x), S(x) and N, where N is the number of the last term.

5. Write a program to calculate y using the formula:
